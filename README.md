This application was made by a dog-lover for dog-lovers! I made this application, because city life for people with dogs isn't always easy. It helps to find solutions to everyday problems like finding a vet, or a dog-park near the user's location.

### Technologies Used

 - SpringBoot
 - H2
 - Postresql
 - Lombok
 - Java
 - ReactJS

## Features
 - **User Authentication / Registration**
	![DogGoesInTheCitySignUp](https://i.imgur.com/VnxPERS.png)
	 Registration is nice and simple as it can be seen on the picture. It doesn't require too much information, and at the end you will even get a nice authentication email as well!

	After this process you can log in (and the log-in text changes to your username under the smiley face! )

 -  **Google Maps Integration**
	You can access the interractable map of Budapest on this page, but it is missing the pointers at the moment. [Work In Progress ! ]

 - **Location Cards**
	On this page, you can find lots of dog friendly restaurants, caf√©s and other establishments displayed as cards, that contain useful information about them.
	 
 - **Navigation Bar**
	 ![DogGoesInTheCityNavbar](https://i.imgur.com/o3tKTwp.png)
	 You can easily navigate the website using this simple navigation bar 		that can be found on the top of the pages.
 - **Recommendation Box**
	If you know or find a new dog friendly place you can recommend it to other users.	 
 
## Upcomming / Planned Features:
 - **Google Places Integration**
	Using the Google Places API, more cards can be added to the places page.
	
 - **Friend & Message System**
	Users will be able to add friends and exchange messages with each other.
